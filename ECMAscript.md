# ECMASCRIPT
ECMA Script, often abbreviated as ES, is the standardized scripting language specification developed by Ecma International. It's the foundation for modern JavaScript, which is used extensively in web development for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. ES defines the rules, syntax, and features that JavaScript engines should adhere to.

#### ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
This was a significant update that brought a wide range of new features, including **arrow functions**, **template literals**, **classes**, **modules**, and the **let and const variable declarations**.
