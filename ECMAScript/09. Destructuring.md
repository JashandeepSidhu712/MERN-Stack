# DESTRUCTURING ARRAYS
Destructuring in JavaScript allows you to extract values from arrays and objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way.

You can destructure arrays by using square brackets []. The order of variables corresponds to the order of elements in the array.

```
var techs = ["C","C++","Java","DSA","Web","React"];
var [t1,t2,t3] = techs;
console.log(t2);
```

**OUTPUT**
```
C++
```

## SWAPPING VARIABLES
Destructuring can be used to easily swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

```
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // Output: 10
console.log(b); // Output: 5
```
