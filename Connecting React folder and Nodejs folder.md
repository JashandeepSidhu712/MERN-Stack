# CONNECTING A REACT FRONTEND WITH A NODE.JS BACKEND

### Separation of Concerns
It follows the principle of separating the frontend and backend concerns. This separation makes your codebase more organized and maintainable. The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the backend handles data processing, business logic, and interactions with databases and external services.

### Scalability
Separating the frontend and backend allows you to scale each part independently. You can allocate more resources to the backend or frontend as needed to handle increased traffic or complexity.

### Security
Keeping the backend separate from the frontend helps improve security. Sensitive operations and data should be handled on the server-side, reducing the risk of exposing critical information or logic to the client-side code.

### Reusability
Backend logic can be reused across different frontend applications, such as mobile apps or other web applications.

## STEP 1
Start React Server
```
npm start
```

Start Nodejs Server
```
node file_name.js
```
## AXIOSS
Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js. 

It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for sending and receiving data from web services or APIs. 

Axios is often used in frontend applications, including React, Vue.js, and Angular, as well as in backend Node.js applications.
