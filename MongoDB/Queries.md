# MONGODB QUERIES

## use 

In MongoDB, you can switch to a specific database using the use command. 

However, please note that this command doesn't create a new database if it doesn't exist; it only switches to an existing one or creates a new collection within the specified database when you perform an operation on it.

```
use database_name
```
