# REACT

React is a JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces in web applications. 

It was developed by Facebook and later open-sourced. React focuses on creating efficient, declarative, and reusable UI components that can efficiently update and render as the application's data changes.

## VIRTUAL DOM
React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. **Changes are first made to this virtual DOM**, and then **React efficiently updates the actual DOM based on the differences**.

## COMPONENT
A component is a **self-contained, reusable piece of UI that can have its own state, properties (props), and lifecycle methods**. 
Components can be composed to build complex UIs.

## PROPS (PROPERTIES)
Props are inputs that a parent component passes to its child components. They are immutable and help in passing data from parent to child.

# STATE
State is a mutable data structure specific to a component. It holds information that can change over time and triggers re-renders when updated.

## JSX (JAVASCRIPT XML)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. React components are typically written using JSX.

## LIFE CYCLE MODELS
These are special methods that are automatically called as a component goes through different stages of its existence, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
